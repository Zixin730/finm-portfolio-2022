    "-\tFor the market factor, we can calculate it by the value-weighted method. In this way, we calculated value-neutral market factor\n",
    "-\tFor size factor, we can also calculate value-weighed size. And the other way is first to divide stocks into different size groups and build value factor that are neutral to size. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tIn the 1990s, DFA saw value stocks greatly under-perform growth stocks, partially driven by the incredible returns of tech stocks. In other periods, the value factor has a relatively good performance. \n",
    "-\tOther than that, value factor has a small correlation to other factors, and adds benefits to the distribution of the portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tOnce the CMA factor, which was largely correlated with HML, is taken out of the tangency portfolio, and doing this four-factor model by AQR, Value factor emerges to be the most significant as it has really low correlations with the remaining factors. HML and RMW had the 2nd highest correlation previously, and the removal of RMW also contributes to a larger weight for HML in the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "-\tSMB now has the highest correlation between the 4 factors with MKT and thus is penalized for it and has the lowest weight in the tangency portfolio\n",
    "-\tAll these style factors can come in handy for both a linear factor decomposition and in a linear pricing model, as long as the combination of these factors do not posit heavy correlations. All the factors have posted positive risk premia for a longer duration, but due regime changes and changes in market microstructure resulting from advancing technologies and changing investor behavior, some factors might now prove to be redundant or might not display positive risk premia for a longer duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes and No. If CAPM worked perfectly, the market portfolio is the tangency portfolio, which has the highest Sharpe ratio. And all assets are on the same SML so that all asset has the same Treynor ratio that is equal to the market factor’s Treynor ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tLong-only momentum has a high correlation to market factor, while long-short momentum has a negative correlation to the market factor. (biggest difference)\n",
    "-\tBesides that, long-only momentum has a higher mean return and the quite same volatility as the long-short momentum factor and thus has a higher Sharpe ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tThe r-squared of BTC auto-regression is 0.1, which shows that BTC has relatively strong momentum. \n",
    "-\tHowever, just for one asset BTC, it is impossible to buy the winner and sell the loser. If we are investing in the cryptocurrency market, momentum may be a possible strategy. - \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 8\n",
